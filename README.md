# Meal Plan Maker
The aim for this project is to create an application that can take a list of leftover ingredients in my fridge and cupboard, and give me some recipes in which I can use them up before they go off.

## How it will be made

**Tech used:** Python, SQLite

The first step is to create a database of recipes, and their respective ingredients. I have chosen to build a database by web-scraping the recipes from ![Gousto](https://www.gousto.co.uk/).
